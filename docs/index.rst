Welcome to zkay's documentation!
================================

zkay is a complete solution for writing, deploying and using privacy-enabled smart contracts on Ethereum.

The zkay language, which is a Solidity-like smart contract language, allows you to easily specify data ownership, reclassification operations and private computations.

Given such a zkay contract, zkay's compiler automatically transforms it into a contract equivalent in terms of privacy and functionality, yet executable on public blockchains, by leveraging cryptographic encryption and non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs.
