# zkay: A Blockchain Privacy Language

zkay (pronounced as `[zi: keÉª]`) is a programming language which enables
automatic compilation of intuitive data privacy specifications to NIZK-enabled
private smart contracts.

## Warning

This is an initial implementation for research purposes. There could be vulnerabilities or bugs, thus it should not be used in production yet.

## Dependencies

First, install the following dependencies with your system's package manager (python >= 3.7 is also required):

#### Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get install default-jdk-headless git build-essential cmake libgmp-dev pkg-config libssl-dev libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev
```

#### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed jdk-openjdk cmake pkgconf openssl gmp boost
```

## End-user Installation
If you simply want to use zkay as a tool, you can install it like this.
```bash
git clone <zkay-repository>
cd zkay
python3 setup.py sdist
pip3 install dist/zkay-{version}.tar.gz

# Note: Once zkay is published this simplifies to `pip3 install zkay`
```

## Development Setup
```bash
git clone <zkay-repository>
cd zkay
pip3 install -e .
```

### Using Docker

Alternatively you can also use docker to install and run zkay.
First install docker, then you can run the image as follows:

```bash
/path/to/zkay$ ./zkay-docker.sh
(base) root@ae09e165bd19:/zkay_host$
```

This command mounts the directory `zkay` from your host as `/zkay_host`
within the docker container. You can run `zkay-docker.sh` also from any other directory `d` on your host.
In this case, `d` is mounted as `/d_host` inside the container.
This allows you to operate on files from your host machine.


### Unit Tests

To run all unit tests, use:
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover --verbose zkay
```

## Usage

### Type-Check Contracts

To type-check a zkay file `test.zkay` without compiling it, run:

```bash
zkay check test.zkay
```

### Strip zkay features from contract

To output a source-location-preserving public solidity
contract which corresponds to `test.zkay` but with all privacy features removed (useful for running analysis tools designed for solidity), run:

```bash
zkay solify test.zkay
```

The transformed code is printed to stdout.

### Deploy library contracts
zkay requires a crypto-backend dependent external PKI (public key infrastructure) contract and
depending on the proving-scheme also additional library contracts on the blockchain to function.

These contracts can be compiled and deployed using the commands:

```bash
zkay deploy-pki <account>
zkay deploy-crypto-libs <account>
```
The 'account' parameter is used to specify the wallet address from which the deployment transaction should be issued.

**Note**: The `groth16` proving scheme, which is enabled by default, does not need any additional libraries,
so the `zkay deploy-crypto-libs` command is not needed unless you manually select a different proving scheme.

**Note**: With the debug 'eth-tester' blockchain backend which zkay uses by default, it is not necessary to manually deploy
these contracts. So those commands are not needed in that case.

[//]: # (We should probably deploy official pki and library contracts on testnet [maybe mainnet],
         to which zkay can connect by default)

### Compile Contracts

To compile a zkay file `test.zkay`

```bash
zkay compile [-o "<output_dir>"] test.zkay
```

This performs the following steps
- Type checking
- Transformation from zkay -> solidity
- NIZK proof circuit compilation and key generation
- Generation of `contract.py` (interface code which does automatic transaction transformation to interact with the zkay contract)

### Package Contract For Distribution

To package a zkay contract which was previously compiled with output directory "./zkay_out" for distribution, run:

```bash
zkay export [-o "<output_filename>"] ./zkay_out
```

This will create an archive, which contains the zkay code, a manifest and the zk-SNARK keys.
The recommended file extension is `*.zkp`.

### Unpack Packaged Contract

To unpack and compile a contract package `contract.zkp`, which was previously created using `zkay export`:

```bash
zkay import [-o "<unpack_directory>"] contract.zkp
```


### Interact with contract

Assuming you have previously compiled a file `test.zkay` with `zkay compile -o "output_dir"` or
have imported a file `contract.zkp` using `zkay import -o "output_dir" contract.zkp`

```bash
zkay run output_dir

# Or alternatively
# cd output_dir
# python3 contract.py
>>> ...
```

You are now in a python shell where you can issue the following commands:
- `help()`: Get a list of all contract functions with arguments
- `user1, user2, ..., userN = create_dummy_accounts(N)`: Get addresses of pre-funded test accounts for experimentation (only supported in `eth-tester` and `ganache` backends)
- `handle = deploy(*constructor_args, user: str)`: Issue a deployment transaction for the contract from the account `user` (address literal).
- `handle = connect(contract_addr: str, user: str)`: Create a handle to interact with the deployed contract at address `contract_addr` from account `user`.
Fails if remote contract does not match local files.
- `handle.address`: Get the address of the deployed contract corresponding to this handle
- `handle.some_func(*args[, value: int])`: The account which created handle issues a zkay transaction which calls the zkay contract function `some_func` with the given arguments.
Encryption, transaction transformation and proof generation happen automatically. If the function is payable, the additional argument `wei_amount` can be used to set the wei amount to be transferred.
- `handle.state.get_raw('varname', *indices): Retrieve the current raw value of state variable `name[indices[0]][indices[1]][...]`.
- `handle.state.get_plain('varname', *indices): Retrieve the current plaintext value (decrypted with @me key if necessary) of state variable `name[indices[0]][indices[1]][...]`.

There are also two more specific commands for deploying or connecting to a single contract instance.

**Note**: The following two commands should not be used with the `eth-tester` backend, as the `eth-tester` blockchain only exists
in memory and does not persist across multiple zkay invocations. Use `zkay run` instead.

#### Deploy a zkay contract

```bash
zkay deploy [--account <addr>] [--blockchain-pki-address <addr>] [--blockchain-crypto-lib-addresses <addr>] output_dir <constructor_args...>
```
Deploy a contract from the specified wallet account and make it use the specified PKI and library contracts, which were
previously deployed using the `zkay deploy-pki` and `zaky deploy-crypto-libs` commands.

#### Connect to and interact with contract instance

```bash
zkay connect [--account <addr>] <output_dir> <contract_address>
```

Open an interactive transaction shell for the contract at `contract_address` using the local files in `output_dir`
using `account` as the sender account from which to issue transactions.

Integrity of the on-chain contract is automatically checked against the local files.

In contrast to the `zkay run` command, the transaction shell starts in the context of the interface object, rather
than in the context of the off-chain transaction simulator module. This means that the contract functions are
available in the global scope of the shell.
